# Meteorological Micro-Climate Monitoring System

## Project Overview
Developed for a university-based research team, this system addresses the challenges of manual environmental data management. It provides a centralized digital framework to capture, synchronize, and analyze high-resolution data from diverse field stations.

## Key Features
* **Integrated Digital Framework:** Eliminates fragmented datasets by centralizing metrics (Temperature, Humidity, Wind Speed, Rainfall) across multiple Station IDs.
* **Automated Data Ingestion:** Standardizes data synchronization from various geographical coordinates to ensure research integrity.
* **Instantaneous Physiological Indicators:** Automates the calculation of the **Heat Index** to provide real-time environmental insights.
* **Longitudinal Data Repository:** Established a standardized storage system for historical data, enabling comparative analysis and long-term trend study.
* **Error Mitigation:** Replaces manual calculation and data entry, significantly reducing the risk of inaccuracies in climate metrics.

## Automated Calculations
The system implements the Heat Index formula to ensure consistency across all readings:
$$Heat Index = T + (0.33 \times H) - 0.70$$

## Tech Stack
* **Language:** Java
* **IDE:** Apache NetBeans
* **Architecture:** Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
* **Concepts:** Data Serialization, Mathematical Modeling, and File I/O.

## Folder Structure
